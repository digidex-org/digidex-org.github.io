		<h1>Anantomy of a Digidex Card</h1>

		<p>A digidex card is simply a JSON object that describes a person, business, product, event, or something else. It is not limited by pre-defined fields, although there are some conventions that you should follow to ensure compatibility across apps.</p>

		<h2>Conventions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Your digidex cards should have a "name" attribute. This is commonly understood to be the title of your card.</li>
			<li>Your digidex card should have a "_cardURL" attribute which links to the image of the card graphic.</li>
			<li>Any attributes that start with an underscore are intended for internal use by a digidex client (such as a mobile app), and are not automatically visisble (however, some clients may choose to implement a "show all" option that will display these hidden fields).</li>
			<li>Any attributes that do not start with an underscore are considered "visible", and will be displayed to the user by default.</li>
			<li>Attributes may contain a nested collection (such as an array or object), but nesting more than one level deep may result in unexpected behavior and should be avoided.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Name</h3>

		<p>The name attribute should naturally be the name of the person, business, product, event, etc that you're describing. You should consider your audience when you select this attribute. For instance, a dentist might choose "Dr. Smith DDS" for their digidex card name instead of their actual first and last name.</p>

		<h3>_cardURL</h3>

		<p>This is the full web url where the card image can be retrieved.</p>

		<h3>_shareURL</h3>

		<p>This is the URL that will be used to share your digidex card. This URL should be a page containing a deep-link

		<h2>Examples</h2>

		<p>Below is a simple example that you might use for yourself.</p>
<pre><code>{
	"_cardURL":"http://example.net/digidex.png",
	"name":"John Appleseed",
	"company":"123 Businesses",
