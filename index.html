		<p>Digidex cards are designed for the web. If a published card's data is updated, the change can be reflected on a user's device. The Digidex ecosystem isn't meant to be controlled by a single person or company. Anyone can create a card for themselves, their business, their product, or their event, and host it on their own website. Sharing a card is as simple as sharing a link.</p>

		<p>Digidex isn't meant to completely replace traditional physical business cards. In fact, they're designed to work <em>with</em> business cards. If you add a QR code link to your own website, a digidex-compatible QR code scanner can discover the digidex record linked within it, and present ito the user.</p>

		<p><a href="http://rectangoapp.com/">Rectango</a> is the premier iOS app for Digidex, developed by the creator of the Digidex format.</p>
