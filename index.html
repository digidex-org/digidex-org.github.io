		<p>Digidex is a way to create, share, and collect business cards digitally. Digidex cards can be connected to the web, so if the card's data is updated, that info can be updated on your device. The Digidex ecosystem isn't meant to be controlled by a single person or company. Anyone can create a card for themselves, their business, their product, or their event, and host it on their own website. Sharing a card is as simple as sharing a link.</p>

		<p>Digidex isn't meant to completely replace traditional physical business cards. In fact, they're designed to work <em>with</em> business cards.</p>

		<p><strong>Digidex Pro for iOS</strong> is the premier smartphone app for Digidex, developed by the creator of the Digidex standard.</p>
